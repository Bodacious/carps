CARPS is a fun little system which automates playing pen and paper role playing games over email.

CARPS can log in to SMTP and IMAP servers and relay commands between players.

Messages are cryptographically signed to prevent spoofing.

CARPS is extensible, so you can add the rules to your favourite game and begin playing.

Note that CARPS is under heavy development - it's something I'm currently hacking on for a bit of a laugh :)
