Feature: safety
   As a CARPS user,
   you essentially run untrusted programs,
   in response to emails,
   it's probably a good idea to use $SAFE.

# This doesn't work, probably bug in cucumber

   Scenario: Perform operations under SAFE
#      Given $SAFE is 1
#      Then allow checking a file, given by user input, exists
#      Then disallow eval in response to user input
