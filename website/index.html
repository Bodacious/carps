<h1>CARPS, the Computer Assisted Role-Playing Game System</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
CARPS, the Computer Assisted Role-Playing Game System, is a tool for
playing pen and paper RPGs over the internet.
</p>
<p>
CARPS differs from other such systems because CARPS is not a
&#8216;real-time&#8217; system.  It suits people who want to log on once or
twice a day, take a turn, and then log out again.  While <em>OpenRPG</em>
could be described as being similar to a chat-room, CARPS is more similar
to an email client.
</p>
<p>
CARPS is an extensible system: game rules are provided by
&#8216;mods&#8217;.
</p>
<p>
CARPS supports these mods by providing:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
Text-mode user interfaces for the players and the dungeon master.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
An easy to use probabalistic API which not only rolls the dice, but can
report the probability of various game events occuring.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
Automated static character sheet verification, according to a schema
defined in YAML.  For example, a game might require your strength to be an
integer.  
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
Support for the semantic validation of character sheets according to game
rules.  For example, a game might require the sum of character&#8217;s
attributes to be below a certain maximum value.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
Together the validation features allow a mod writer to encode game rules
cleanly, as they do not need to consider the possibility of receiving an
invalid sheet.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
CARPS has other strengths:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
<b>Anyone</b> can play or host a CARPS game because CARPS&#8217; protocol
is implemented on top of email. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
CARPS is designed to be secure.  Multiple email security options are
supported, and all CARPS messages are cryptographically signed to prevent
spoofing.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
You can instruct CARPS to use your favourite text editor and terminal
emulator.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
CARPS is easy to configure because it includes a wizard.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>However</b>, CARPS is new and the following features, which you might
take for granted, are not yet supported:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
No GUI
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
No support for maps
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
No chat - all communication goes through the Game Master.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
Games are currently invite only, at the discretion of the Game Master.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
Security mechanisms are <b>not</b> well audited.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<p>
For users:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
ruby 1.9
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
rubygems
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
openssl
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
highline
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For developing CARPS, you will also need:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
hoe
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
rake
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
newgem
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
cucumber
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>To Install:</h2>
<p>
<tt># Install the gem</tt>
</p>
<p>
<tt>sudo gem install carps</tt>
</p>
<p>
<tt># Initialize the carps user directory.  Run this as your everyday
user.</tt>
</p>
<p>
<tt>carps_init</tt>
</p>
<h2>Basic Instructions:</h2>
<p>
Run carps -h for help
</p>
<p>
The first time CARPS is run, it will launch a wizard to help you configure
your email settings, and choose a text editor and a terminal emulator.
</p>
<p>
It is a good idea to specify a terminal emulator, as then CARPS can launch
a mod in a new window (or similar).  Then the first CARPS window will act
as an email logger, letting you see when you receive mails, without
interfering with the text you type into the new window.
</p>
<p>
You&#8217;re also going to need to install a mod to play CARPS.  See the
example &#8216;fools&#8217; mod:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
<a href="http://fools.rubyforge.org">fools.rubyforge.org</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Campaigns (For the DM):</h2>
<p>
When you set up a new game, CARPS will ask for you to enter the name of a
campaign.
</p>
<p>
This allows you to create game resources prior to starting a game.
</p>
<p>
For example, the following applies if your mod is called foo, the campaign
is called bar, and your carps user data directory is /home/user/carps
</p>
<p>
You should create the following directories
</p>
<p>
the campaign directory: 
</p>
<p>
<tt>/home/user/carps/dm/campaigns/foo/bar</tt>
</p>
<p>
the NPCSs directory: 
</p>
<p>
<tt>/home/user/carps/dm/campaigns/foo/bar/npcs</tt>
</p>
<p>
the rooms directory: 
</p>
<p>
<tt>/home/user/carps/dm/campaigns/foo/bar/rooms</tt>
</p>
<p>
NPCs are defined as YAML files, according to the mod&#8217;s schema.  Put
them in the NPCs directory.  They MUST have the <tt>.yaml</tt> extension.
</p>
<p>
Rooms are defined as text files.  These are just predefined pieces of prose
that the DM will send to the players when they enter a room, for instance. 
Put them in the rooms directory.  They MUST have the <tt>.txt</tt>
extension.
