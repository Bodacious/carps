h1. CARPS
h2. The Computer Assisted Role-Playing Game System

CARPS is a tool for playing pen and paper RPGs over the internet.

CARPS differs from other such systems because CARPS is not a 'real-time' system.  It suits people who want to log on once or twice a day, take a turn, and then log out again.  While OpenRPG could be described as being similar to a chat-room, CARPS is more similar to an email client.

CARPS is an extensible system: game rules are provided by 'mods'.

== REQUIREMENTS:

For users:

* ruby 1.9

* rubygems

* openssl

* highline

For developing CARPS, you will also need:

* hoe

* newgem

* cucumber

== INSTALL:

# Install the gem

sudo rake install_gem

# Create the CARPS data directory

# Installed into your home directory (/home/user/carps)

rake setup_carps_dir

== CAMPAIGNS (For the DM):

When you set up a new game, CARPS will ask for you to enter the name of a campaign.

This allows you to create game resources prior to starting a game.

For example, the following applies if your mod is called foo, the campaign is called bar, and your carps user data directory is /home/user/carps

You should create the following directories

the campaign directory: /home/user/carps/dm/campaigns/foo/bar

the NPCSs directory: /home/user/carps/dm/campaigns/foo/bar/npcs

the rooms directory: /home/user/carps/dm/campaigns/foo/bar/rooms

NPCs can be defined as YAML files, according to the mod's schema.  Put them in the NPCs directory.  They MUST have the .yaml extension.

Rooms can be defined as text files.  These are just predefined pieces of prose that the DM will send to the players when they enter a room, for instance.  Put them in the rooms directory.  They MUST have the .txt extension.
